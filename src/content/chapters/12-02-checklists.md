# 12.2 Checklists

These checklists are practical, ready-to-use quick references. Copy any checklist into a pull request template, a wiki page, a ticket, or a review meeting agenda, and adapt the items to your context. Treat each item as something a person can verify and answer yes or no. A checklist is a memory aid and a shared standard, not a substitute for judgment; delete items that do not apply and add items your domain requires.

Guidance for using these well:

- Keep checklists short enough that people actually complete them. If a checklist is routinely skipped, it is too long or too generic.
- Automate any item a machine can verify (formatting, tests, scans) so humans spend attention on judgment items.
- Version your checklists and review them periodically. A checklist that never changes is probably not being used.
- Distinguish blocking items from advisory items when the distinction matters for your process.

## Code review checklist

For the reviewer examining someone else's change.

- [ ] The change does what its description and linked ticket say it does.
- [ ] The scope is focused on a single logical concern; unrelated changes are split out.
- [ ] The design fits the existing architecture and does not introduce a simpler-to-avoid coupling.
- [ ] Edge cases, error paths, and failure modes are handled, not just the happy path.
- [ ] Tests exist, are meaningful, and would fail if the behaviour regressed.
- [ ] Naming, structure, and comments make the code understandable to a future reader.
- [ ] No secrets, credentials, tokens, or personal data are committed.
- [ ] Security-sensitive input is validated, encoded, or parameterized appropriately.
- [ ] Public interfaces, contracts, and backward compatibility are preserved or intentionally versioned.
- [ ] Logging, metrics, and error reporting are adequate to operate the change in production.
- [ ] Documentation, runbooks, and configuration are updated to match the change.
- [ ] Feedback is separated into blocking issues versus suggestions, and phrased about the code.

## Pull request author checklist

For the author before requesting review.
