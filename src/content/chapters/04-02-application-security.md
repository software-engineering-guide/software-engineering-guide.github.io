# 4.2 Application security

## Overview and motivation

Application security is where abstract threats meet concrete code. Most breaches that reach the headlines trace back to an application-layer flaw: an injection, a broken authentication flow, an exposed secret, or a compromised dependency. For large teams shipping many services, the hard part is not knowing these flaws exist. It is preventing them consistently across a sprawling codebase written by thousands of hands over many years.

For enterprises, application security is a matter of customer trust and regulatory obligation. A flaw in a login flow or a payment path can trigger fraud, fines, and mandatory breach disclosure. Government systems face the same technical risks with higher-stakes data: benefits eligibility, tax records, criminal justice data, and national infrastructure. In both settings, the application is the front door, and attackers probe it constantly and automatically.

This chapter covers the practices that keep applications resilient: knowing and defending against the common vulnerability classes, validating input and encoding output, getting authentication and authorization right, managing secrets, and securing the software supply chain that increasingly determines your real attack surface.

*See also:* chapter 4.1 (security foundations, threat modeling, and the secure development lifecycle), chapter 10.3 (open-source supply chain and licensing), and chapter 10.2 (SBOMs, risk, and assurance).

## Key principles

- **Never trust input.** Treat all data crossing a trust boundary as hostile until validated.
- **Secure defaults.** The safe path should be the easy path; insecure behaviour should require deliberate, visible effort.
- **Fail closed.** When a security check cannot complete, deny access rather than allow it.
- **Defence in depth at the app layer.** Combine validation, encoding, parameterization, and framework protections; do not rely on one.
- **Least privilege for identities and tokens.** Scope credentials narrowly and expire them quickly.
- **Your dependencies are your code.** You are responsible for the security of everything you ship, including third-party and open-source components.
- **Standards over improvisation.** Use vetted frameworks such as the [OWASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OWASP) (Open Worldwide Application Security Project) ASVS rather than inventing your own security controls.

## Recommendations

### Know and defend the OWASP Top 10, verify with ASVS

The OWASP Top 10 is the industry baseline list of the most critical web application risks: broken access control, cryptographic failures, injection, insecure design, security misconfiguration, vulnerable components, authentication failures, data integrity failures, logging failures, and server-side request forgery. Treat it as required knowledge for every engineer, not just a compliance reference to file away.

For a rigorous, testable standard, adopt the **OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)**. ASVS defines security requirements at three levels of assurance, giving you concrete, auditable controls to design and test against. Pick the level that fits each application's risk, and verify against it.

### Validate input and encode output

Injection flaws stay among the most damaging precisely because they are so easy to introduce. Defend with layered controls:

- **Validate input** against strict allow-lists (expected type, length, format, range). Reject rather than sanitize where you can.
- **Use parameterized queries** and [prepared statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement) for all database access; never build SQL by string concatenation. Use safe query builders and ORMs (object-relational mappers) correctly.
- **Encode output** contextually. HTML, HTML attributes, JavaScript, URLs, and CSS each require different encoding. Rely on framework auto-escaping and understand its limits.
- **Prevent [cross-site scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) (XSS)** with output encoding plus a strong Content Security Policy as a second layer.
- **Prevent command and template injection** by avoiding shelling out with untrusted data and by using logic-less or sandboxed templates.

### Get authentication and authorization right

Authentication proves who a user is. Authorization decides what they may do. Both fail often, so get them right.

- Prefer established protocols: **[OAuth 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth)** for delegated authorization and **[OpenID Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect) (OIDC)** for authentication. Do not build these from scratch.
- Enforce **[multi-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) (MFA)**, especially for privileged and administrative access.
- Store passwords only as salted hashes using a modern, slow, memory-hard algorithm (such as [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) or [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)). Never store or log plaintext credentials.
- Manage **sessions** carefully: generate cryptographically strong tokens, set secure and HttpOnly cookie flags, rotate on privilege change, and expire idle sessions.
- Enforce **authorization on the server for every request**, checking that the authenticated principal owns or may access the specific resource. Broken object-level authorization (accessing another user's record by changing an ID) is one of the most common and severe API flaws.
- Centralize authorization logic where practical so policy is consistent and auditable.

### Manage secrets and rotate keys

Hardcoded secrets in source code are a perennial cause of breaches. Build a disciplined habit around secret management:

- Store secrets in a dedicated secrets manager or vault, never in source, config files, or environment variables checked into version control.
- Scan commits and repositories for leaked secrets automatically, and block merges that introduce them.
- Rotate keys and credentials regularly and immediately upon any suspected exposure. Prefer short-lived, automatically issued credentials over long-lived static ones.
- Apply least privilege to every secret: scope it to exactly what it needs.
- Encrypt secrets at rest and in transit, and audit access to them.

### Secure the software supply chain

Modern applications are mostly assembled from third-party components, which makes the supply chain a primary attack surface.

- Maintain a **[Software Bill of Materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bill_of_materials) (SBOM)** for every application so you know exactly what you ship and can respond fast when a new vulnerability lands.
- Continuously scan dependencies (Software Composition Analysis, or SCA) and remediate known-vulnerable components promptly.
- Pin and verify dependency versions; use lockfiles and trusted registries.
- Adopt **SLSA** (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) to raise build integrity, and generate **provenance** attestations describing how artefacts were built.
- **Sign artefacts** and verify signatures before deployment so you can trust that what runs is what you built.
- Secure the build system itself; a compromised CI pipeline can inject malicious code into every downstream consumer.

## Trade-offs: pros and cons

| Decision | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| Buy/adopt identity provider (OIDC) | Battle-tested, MFA built in, less code to secure | Vendor dependency, integration effort, cost |
| Build custom auth | Full control, no external dependency | Extremely easy to get wrong, high maintenance |
| Strict allow-list validation | Blocks whole vulnerability classes | Can break legitimate edge cases, more upfront work |
| Short-lived credentials | Small breach window, auto-revocation | Requires robust issuance infrastructure |
| Aggressive dependency updates | Fewer known vulnerabilities | Churn, potential breaking changes, test burden |
| SBOM + signing + provenance | Fast incident response, verifiable trust | Tooling and process investment, cultural change |

The recurring trade-off is upfront rigor versus ongoing exposure. Building custom authentication or skipping dependency hygiene feels faster today and costs you enormously later. Adopting vetted standards and automated supply-chain controls costs effort now, but it turns an unbounded, unpredictable risk into a managed, bounded one. For large teams, the automation multiplier matters most: a control applied once in a paved-road template protects every service that uses it.

## Questions to discuss with your team

1. **Which ASVS controls will you bake into your paved-road framework so engineers get them for free?** The highest-leverage move for a large team is to make the safe path the default, so a control written once in a shared framework protects every service that adopts it. Decide which ASVS requirements (parameterized queries, output encoding, secure session flags, server-side authorization checks) belong in the template rather than in each engineer's memory. For enterprise and government portfolios, also decide which applications need ASVS Level 2 versus Level 3, and tie that to the sensitivity of the data each one touches. Bring a list of your services and mark which ones already inherit these defaults and which reimplement security by hand, because the hand-rolled ones are where injection and broken access control hide. If secure defaults live only in a wiki page, they will be skipped under delivery pressure, so put them in code.

2. **How will you find and fix broken object-level authorization across every API, not just the new ones?** Accessing another user's record by changing an ID is one of the most common and severe API flaws, and it hides in older endpoints that predate your current standards. Server-side authorization on every request and every object is the rule, but the hard part is verifying it holds across a sprawling, years-old codebase written by many hands. Decide whether you will centralize authorization logic, add automated tests that attempt cross-tenant access, or run targeted testing against your highest-risk APIs first. Bring your inventory of endpoints that expose object identifiers and rank them by the sensitivity of what they return. Without a deliberate sweep, you will keep shipping this flaw and discover it only when a researcher or an attacker does.

3. **What is your plan for the next widespread dependency vulnerability: how fast can you find and patch every affected service?** When a critical flaw lands in a popular library, the companies with an accurate SBOM identify affected services in hours while others spend weeks searching, and that speed gap decides how much damage you take. Decide now whether you produce a Software Bill of Materials for every artefact, whether dependency scanning runs in every pipeline, and who owns the emergency patch decision. For regulated and government buyers, SBOMs and signed provenance are increasingly a condition of doing business, so this readiness also protects revenue. Bring the honest answer to a drill: pick a library you use widely and time how long it takes to list every service that ships it. If the answer is measured in days, invest in inventory and signing before the next incident forces you to.

4. **How will you move from long-lived static secrets to short-lived, automatically issued credentials, and which systems block that today?** Hardcoded and long-lived secrets are a perennial breach cause, and the fix, short-lived credentials issued on demand, depends on issuance infrastructure that older systems often cannot use. For a large team the danger is uneven adoption: a modern platform rotates keys hourly while a legacy service still ships a static database password in a config file. Decide which workloads can consume a secrets manager or workload-identity system now, which need investment first, and who owns the rotation runbook the moment a key is suspected leaked. Bring an inventory of every credential in use, its lifetime, its blast radius if exposed, and whether commit scanning would catch it before merge. In enterprise and government settings, tie this to audit: examiners increasingly expect evidence of rotation, scoped access, and access logging for every secret, and a static credential you cannot rotate without downtime is a finding waiting to be written up.

5. **Where do you still run homegrown or inconsistent authentication, and what is the plan to consolidate on vetted protocols?** Building authentication is one of the easiest ways to introduce subtle, exploitable flaws, yet most large estates carry at least one legacy login flow that predates the decision to standardize on OAuth 2.0 and OIDC. The competing pressures are real: migrating an old flow risks breaking existing users and integrations, while leaving it in place keeps a high-value target under-defended. Decide whether you consolidate on a single identity provider, enforce MFA uniformly, and set a deadline to retire each bespoke flow, or accept documented exceptions with compensating controls. Bring a map of every authentication path in the fleet, which enforce MFA, which store passwords with a modern memory-hard hash, and which are custom. For enterprise and government portfolios, add the compliance angle: standards such as NIST SP 800-63 set concrete expectations for identity assurance, and a homegrown flow that cannot demonstrate them will not survive an audit or an authority-to-operate review.

6. **How do you verify that these controls actually hold in production, and can you prove it with evidence rather than assertion?** Writing a secure default is not the same as knowing every service still honours it, and controls quietly rot as code changes, exceptions pile up, and new endpoints ship. For a large team the question is coverage: which services run static analysis, dependency scanning, and dynamic or penetration testing, and how do you know the ones that skip them are not your highest-risk applications? Decide what verification is mandatory in the pipeline versus periodic, who triages the findings, and what evidence you retain to show a control was tested and passing on a given date. Bring your current coverage map, your mean time to remediate by severity, and the list of applications with no recent test. In regulated and government contexts, this evidence is not optional: auditors, authorizing officials, and breach investigators all ask for proof that controls were verified, and a policy with no test records rarely satisfies them.

## Sector lens

**Startup.** With two or three engineers and no security specialist, your leverage is to inherit security rather than build it: adopt a managed OIDC identity provider, lean on a framework whose ORM parameterizes queries by default, and keep secrets in your platform's secret manager rather than `.env` files a teammate might commit by accident. Turn on automated dependency scanning that opens patch pull requests, and treat that as enough for now. Do not build custom auth or crypto, because a single injected query or one leaked key can end the company before it has customers.

**Small business.** You likely have no application-security specialist and a tight budget, so buy controls embedded in the tools and platforms you already pay for rather than staffing a dedicated function. Choose a hosted identity provider with MFA included, a managed database that steers you toward parameterized access, and a repository host that scans commits for leaked secrets out of the box. Concentrate your scarce attention on the OWASP Top 10 basics that cause most real-world breaches, and prefer vendors who ship secure defaults you cannot casually switch off.

**Enterprise.** Across many teams the challenge is consistency: bake ASVS controls into paved-road frameworks so every new service inherits parameterized queries, output encoding, secure sessions, and server-side authorization for free. Run accurate SBOMs and fleet-wide dependency scanning so the next widespread library vulnerability is a matter of hours, not weeks, and centralize authorization policy so cross-tenant access becomes testable. Standardize on one identity provider with enforced MFA, and manage application security as a governed portfolio with risk-tiered ASVS levels and audited evidence.

**Government.** Procurement rules, transparency, and public accountability shape the controls you must demonstrate, not merely implement. Verify citizen-facing services against OWASP ASVS at a level matched to data sensitivity, sign every deployed artefact and attest its provenance per SLSA to satisfy supply-chain mandates, and issue short-lived credentials from a central vault with full access logging. Expect to show auditors and authorizing officials a documented chain of custody from source to production, and align identity assurance to published standards such as NIST SP 800-63.

## Examples

**Startup.** A three-engineer SaaS team skips building its own login and adopts a managed OIDC provider on day one, gaining MFA and safe password resets without writing security-critical code it cannot afford to get wrong. It relies on the framework's ORM so queries are parameterized by default, keeps secrets in the platform's secret manager rather than in `.env` files a teammate might commit by accident, and turns on automated dependency scanning that opens a pull request when a library needs patching. None of this slows the team down, and it means one leaked key or one injected query does not end the company before it has customers.

**Enterprise.** A retail platform serving tens of millions of shoppers standardizes authentication on OIDC through a single identity provider, enforcing MFA for staff and step-up authentication for high-value account changes. All database access goes through an ORM configured to parameterize queries, and a Content Security Policy backs up output encoding. After a widely publicized vulnerability in a popular logging library, the company's SBOM lets it identify every affected service within hours and patch them in two days, while competitors without inventories spent weeks searching.

**Government.** A federal benefits agency builds citizen-facing services verified against OWASP ASVS Level 2, with Level 3 for the components handling the most sensitive records. Secrets live in a central vault issuing short-lived credentials; commit scanning blocks any leaked key. Every deployed artefact is signed and its provenance attested per SLSA, satisfying a federal mandate for verifiable software supply chains and giving auditors a clear chain of custody from source to production.

## Business case: motivations, ROI, and TCO

Application security spending buys down the most likely and most expensive category of breach. The total cost of ownership includes tooling (scanners, secret managers, identity providers), engineer time to remediate findings, and the mild friction of secure defaults. Against that, weigh the cost of skipping it: injection and broken-access-control breaches routinely expose millions of records, triggering regulatory fines, mandatory notification, fraud losses, remediation sprints, and reputational damage that suppresses revenue for years.

The ROI is strongest when controls are automated and reused. A single well-configured identity integration, one hardened query layer in a shared framework, and one pipeline that blocks vulnerable dependencies protect the whole fleet at marginal cost per service. Supply-chain controls in particular have gone from optional to essential: a compromised dependency can turn every one of your customers into a victim, and regulators and enterprise buyers increasingly require SBOMs and signed provenance as a condition of doing business. When you make the case to leadership, tie the investment to specific, named risks and to procurement and compliance requirements that block revenue if you fail to meet them.

## Anti-patterns and pitfalls

- **Rolling your own crypto or auth.** Almost always produces subtle, exploitable flaws.
- **Client-side-only validation.** Trivially bypassed; the server must revalidate everything.
- **Blocklist sanitization.** Trying to strip "bad" characters instead of allow-listing good ones; attackers find the gaps.
- **Secrets in source or environment files.** The single most common cause of credential leaks.
- **Ignoring authorization on object access.** Assuming an authenticated user may access any object whose ID they can guess.
- **Set-and-forget dependencies.** Never updating third-party components until a breach forces it.
- **Treating the Top 10 as the finish line.** It is a floor, not a comprehensive standard; use ASVS for depth.
- **Logging sensitive data.** Passwords, tokens, and PII (personally identifiable information) in logs become a breach waiting to happen.

## Maturity model

**Level 1: Initiate.** Application security depends on individual developer knowledge and reacts only after incidents. No standard controls. Secrets sit in source. Dependencies are rarely updated. Authentication is custom and ad hoc, and injection or broken-access-control flaws are found by luck rather than by process.

**Level 2: Develop.** Basic practices appear but vary team to team. OWASP Top 10 awareness spreads, some framework-level protections are in place, and a secrets manager exists but is used unevenly. Dependency scanning runs occasionally. New systems adopt a standard identity provider, while older services keep their homegrown login flows untouched.

**Level 3: Standardize.** Controls are documented and enforced across the organization. ASVS-based requirements are set per risk tier, parameterized queries and output encoding are the norm, and a central identity provider with MFA is required. Secrets are managed and scanned automatically, SBOMs are produced, and dependency scanning runs in every pipeline.

**Level 4: Manage.** The practice is measured and controlled against baselines. Scan and test coverage, mean time to remediate by severity, the share of services inheriting paved-road defaults, credential and secret rotation age, and ASVS conformance are all tracked on dashboards. Exceptions are logged with expiry dates, drift from the baseline triggers action, and releases are gated on defined security thresholds rather than judgement calls.

**Level 5: Orchestrate.** Security is continuously improved and integrated across the organization. Secure defaults are built into paved-road frameworks so the safe path is automatic, short-lived credentials are used everywhere, and full supply-chain assurance with signing and provenance (SLSA) is standard. Verification is continuous, response to new vulnerabilities is rapid and measured, and each incident feeds back into the shared templates so a single fix hardens the whole fleet.

## Ideas for discussion

1. Where should authorization logic live to be both consistent and maintainable across many services?
2. How aggressively should you update dependencies given the trade-off between exposure and churn?
3. What ASVS level is appropriate for each class of application in your portfolio?
4. How do you eliminate long-lived secrets without creating fragile issuance infrastructure?
5. What would it take for your organization to produce and consume SBOMs and provenance for every artefact?
6. How do you keep secure defaults from being disabled under delivery pressure?

## Key takeaways

- The OWASP Top 10 is essential knowledge; ASVS provides the testable standard.
- Layer input validation, parameterization, and output encoding to defeat injection and XSS.
