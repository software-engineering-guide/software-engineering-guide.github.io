# 12.5 References

This section consolidates the guidebook's reference apparatus: a crosswalk to
the SWEBOK body of knowledge, an index of the standards and frameworks cited
throughout, and a curated bibliography of recommended reading. Per-chapter
sources also appear in the *References and further reading* section at the end
of each chapter.

# SWEBOK crosswalk

This guidebook is aligned with the IEEE Computer Society's **SWEBOK V4.0**
(Software Engineering Body of Knowledge). All 18 knowledge areas are covered;
the table maps each to the chapters that treat it, and the guidebook then goes
well beyond SWEBOK into AI, data, UX, DevOps, sustainability, flow, and
public-interest technology.

# Standards and frameworks

This appendix is an organized index of the real standards, frameworks, and
regulations referenced throughout the guidebook. It is a navigational aid, not a
compliance manual: always consult the authoritative source and, where relevant,
qualified legal or audit counsel for the current text and applicability to your
context.

Entries are grouped by domain. Each names the standard or framework, its issuing
body, a one-line scope, and the chapters or domains where it is most relevant.
Where a name is commonly abbreviated, the abbreviation is shown. Document numbers
and titles are given only where they are well established; no URLs are included.

## How to use this appendix

- **Regulations** (for example, GDPR, HIPAA) are legally binding within their
  jurisdiction and sector. They set obligations, not just good practice.
- **Standards** (for example, ISO/IEC 27001, WCAG) are formal, often
  certifiable specifications. Some are voluntary; some are mandated by law or
  contract.
- **Frameworks** (for example, NIST CSF, NIST AI RMF) are structured, usually
  voluntary guidance you tailor to your risk profile.
- Applicability depends on jurisdiction, sector, data types, and contractual
  terms. Many organizations must satisfy several of these at once.

## Notes on scope and change

Standards and regulations evolve. Version numbers (for example, WCAG 2.1 versus
2.2, or ISO revision years) and control catalogues change over time, and new laws
(such as sector-specific AI and resilience regulations) continue to emerge. Treat
this appendix as a starting map: confirm the current version, jurisdiction, and
applicability before relying on any entry for a compliance or procurement
decision. Where the guidebook chapters and this appendix differ in detail, the
authoritative source document always governs.

# Recommended reading

This appendix is a curated, annotated reading list spanning every domain of the
guidebook. It favours works that have shaped practice at scale: acknowledged
classics, rigorous references, and the standards and reports that large,
enterprise, and government teams are measured against.

Each entry gives the title and author(s), followed by one sentence on why it
matters. The list is organized under the book's ten parts. Read selectively:
pick the two or three works nearest your current pain, not the whole shelf.
Where a work spans domains, it is placed where it is most useful; many belong
in several parts.

A note on standards: bodies such as NIST, OWASP, W3C/WCAG, ISO, and the DORA
programme publish living documents that are periodically revised. Cite and read
the current version; the annotations below describe their enduring purpose.

## How to use this list

- **Start with your pain.** If deployments are slow and scary, read *Accelerate*, *Continuous Delivery*, and the *DORA* reports before anything else.
- **Read for the decade, not the sprint.** Prefer the works that explain enduring principles over those tied to a specific tool version.
- **Verify the current edition of standards.** NIST, OWASP, WCAG, ISO, and DORA revise their publications; always work from the latest release and note the version in your own policies.
- **Build a shared shelf.** A team that has read two or three of these books in common argues less and decides faster, because it shares a vocabulary and a set of reference points.
- **See also chapter 12.5** for the full index of reference standards and frameworks, and **chapter 12.6** for how to sequence the adoption of the practices these works describe.
