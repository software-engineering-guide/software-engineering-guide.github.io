# 12.3 Templates

These templates are copy-paste-ready starting points. Lift any template into your wiki, repository, or ticketing system and fill in the bracketed placeholders. Italicized notes and inline comments explain what belongs in each section; delete them once the section is filled. Keep templates lightweight: a template that is faster to skip than to complete will not be used. Adapt headings and sections to your organization, but preserve the intent of each part.

A few conventions used below:

- Text in `[square brackets]` is a placeholder to replace.
- Text in _italics_ or `<!-- comments -->` is guidance to delete.
- Keep the finished document as short as it can be while still answering its questions.
