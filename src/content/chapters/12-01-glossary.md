# 12.1 Glossary

This glossary defines terms and acronyms used throughout the guidebook. Entries
are grouped alphabetically. Where an entry has a common acronym, it is shown in
parentheses. Definitions are intentionally concise; consult the relevant chapter
for fuller treatment.

## A

**[ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control)**: An authorization model that grants access based on evaluated attributes of the user, resource, action, and environment (for example, department, clearance, time of day) rather than fixed roles. It offers fine-grained, policy-driven control at the cost of greater complexity than RBAC.

**[Accessibility (a11y)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility)**: The practice of designing and building software so that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with it. The "a11y" numeronym abbreviates the 11 letters between "a" and "y."

**ADR (Architecture Decision Record)**: A short, versioned document that captures a single significant architectural or technical decision, its context, the options considered, and its consequences. ADRs create a durable, reviewable history of why a system is the way it is.

**Aggregate**: In Domain-Driven Design, a cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit for data changes, with one entity acting as the aggregate root that enforces invariants. Aggregates define consistency and transaction boundaries.

**[API (Application Programming Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)**: A defined contract through which one piece of software requests services or data from another. Well-designed APIs hide implementation detail and provide stable, versioned interfaces.

**API-first**: A development approach in which the API contract is designed and agreed before implementation, so that consumers and providers can work in parallel against a shared specification.

**arc42**: An open, template-based structure for documenting software architecture, organized into twelve sections covering context, constraints, building blocks, runtime, deployment, and decisions.

**[ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAI-ARIA)**: A W3C specification defining roles, states, and properties that make dynamic and custom web components understandable to assistive technologies such as screen readers.

**[Technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt)**: The implied future cost of choosing an expedient solution now over a better one that would take longer, which must be managed deliberately rather than accrued unconsciously.

**TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: A classic weighting scheme that scores a term's importance to a document by how often it appears there, offset by how common it is across the whole corpus. It underlies much of lexical search ranking.

**[Theory of constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints)**: A management approach holding that a system's throughput is limited by a single bottleneck at any time, so improvement efforts should focus on that constraint until it moves elsewhere.
