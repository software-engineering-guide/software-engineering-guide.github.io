# About this project

Project documentation for the guidebook: how it is put together, how to build and
check it, and where the source of truth lives. For the book itself, see the
[table of contents](../index.md).

## Map of the project

- **The book:** `docs/chapters/` (100 files), `docs/front-matter/`, and the
  appendices in Part 12.
- **Source of truth:** `spec/` at the repository root (not published to the
  site). The structure is declared in `spec/structure.md` and the writing rules
  in `spec/conventions.md`. Everything else is built to match.
- **Tooling:** `tools/gen_nav.py` generates navigation; `tests/validate.py`
  enforces the spec; the `justfile` wires them together; `zensical.toml`
  configures the published site.
- **Contributor guidance:**
  [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/software-engineering-guide/software-engineering-guide/blob/main/AGENTS.md)
  at the repository root, and the guides in the
  [contributing section](../contributing/index.md).

## Build and check

The validation suite runs on Python 3 with no other dependencies and no network
access. The site build uses [Zensical](https://zensical.org/), managed with
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/); tasks run through
[just](https://github.com/casey/just).

```sh
just test    # validate structure, style, links, and spec-vs-disk
just nav     # regenerate the generated navigation files
just check   # nav, then test
just build   # build the documentation site into site/
just serve   # serve the site locally with live reload
just stats   # chapter and word counts
```

How the published site is built and deployed is described in
[`SITE.md`](https://github.com/software-engineering-guide/software-engineering-guide/blob/main/SITE.md)
at the repository root.

## How specification-driven development works here

The specification comes first. `spec/structure.md` says which chapters exist and
how they are numbered. `spec/conventions.md` says how they must be written. The
chapters are authored to satisfy both. `tools/gen_nav.py` derives the navigation
from the chapters, and `tests/validate.py` checks the result back against the
spec. If the chapters and the spec ever disagree, the tests fail, which is the
signal to bring them back into line.

This keeps drift out: a change is only "done" when the spec, the chapters, the
generated navigation, and the tests all agree.

## Design decisions worth knowing

- **Flat, decimal-numbered chapters.** Files are `docs/chapters/N.M-slug.md`.
  The part is a whole number; the chapter is a decimal; N.0 is the part
  introduction. This keeps stable identifiers and lets tools sort and group
  without a directory tree.
- **Generated navigation.** The table of contents, contents page, subject
  index, and the site navigation in `zensical.toml` are generated, so they
  never drift from the chapters.
- **Offline, dependency-free tests.** The suite uses only the standard library so
  it runs anywhere, including CI and pre-commit hooks.
- **Cross-references are auto-linked at build time.** Prose refers to
  chapters by decimal number ("see chapter 8.1"), as the spec requires. The
  `guide_xref` Markdown extension turns those references into links when
  Zensical builds the site, so the sources stay plain and the site stays
  navigable. `tests/test_xref.py` pins down what does and does not get linked.
- **No em-dashes, by rule and by test.** A deliberate style choice, enforced so
  it stays true as the book grows.
